Papadopoulos Charalampos
HPC - Project. Parallelization of Google Pagerank 
Matlab version
*******************************************************
Due to problems with Matlab on discovery cluster I
decided to run this only on my laptop. I could not get
an interactive node on discovery cluster and had issues 
with licenses
*******************************************************
Instructions:
Put the pagerank.m file together with the web-Google.txt 
file on your matlab working directory. Set the no_workers
to the number of workers you want (and system allows)
Press run. Wait for several minutes till compilation ends
